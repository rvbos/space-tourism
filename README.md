## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first such complex and big project. I did it on a course run by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - he is one of my favourite web development teachers. I enjoy learning from his videos.

This project helped me to learn a lot of new skills and gain valuable experience, especially in HTML and CSS. Kevin's emphasis is on mobile first and accessibility. Doing this course has broadened my perspective on web development.
